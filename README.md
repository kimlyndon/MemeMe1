# MemeMe1
## UIKit Fundamentals
Previous updates to this project were unsuccessful for prior submissions to Udacity Reviewers (such as the updated storyboard constraints and the info.plist privacy keys). Repo was deleted and reestablished with completed requirements of:

* Create reusable method that accepts a UITextField and the String to set the text to as parameters and use it for setting up
  both text fields. 
* Create reusable mehtod that accepts UIImagePickerControllerSourceType as a parameter and use it for the camera and album
  buttons. 
  
  ## Third Review
* Add value to privacy key (camera)
* Add value to privacy key (photo album)
* Add constraint to top of navigation bar
